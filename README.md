This project is intended to overhaul the Minecraft dog AI by adding features such as better environmental danger detection, autonomous dog behavior (idle states), working dogs (sledding, herding, hunting, detection), and trainable behavior reinforced via treats or praise in the chat.   

This uses the Q-Learning reinforcement algorithm. 

I do not advise using this plugin in its current state. 

Features already implemented:
- Q-Learning framework
- Chat, combat, and wolf taming listeners
- Environmental danger detection
- Attack, flee, follow, sit, and stay goals


Todo:
- Even better environmental danger detection
- Goal transition refinement
- Dog breed traits (propensity to herd, etc.)
- Working dog behaviors
- Sheep flocking behaviors to assist herding behaviors
- Genetic passing down of traits
